    "Think of the REMARO project example. Imagine having to repair a pipeline to an offshore terminal with your robots. You probably want to have a weather ontology that you can query for the best/ worst weather conditions to plan your work. This is exactly what we will do in this exercise!\n",

    "What you will do here:\n",
    "1. Create a basic weather data ontology\n",
    "2. Choose a website with REST API to query current weather data for an offshore terminal\n",
